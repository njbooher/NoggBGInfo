NoggBGInfo is a small World of Warcraft addon for battlegrounds that displays how many tanks/healers/dps/ each team has, how many players on the team are from Latin America / Brazil, and the names of players on the team with <1000 resilience. It was inspired by BGSpy.

#Installation

Install EKInspect and apply EKInspect.diff, then add this folder to your AddOns directory.

#How to Use

The slash command `/noggbg` will print stats to the default chat frame. Checking player resilience takes some time so you may have to try the command a few times before the player resilience stats are accurate. `/noggbg c` will announce stats to battleground chat.
